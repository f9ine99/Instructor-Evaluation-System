# Instructor Evaluation System

A clean, responsive web application designed to collect and manage student evaluations for instructors. This project is currently a **hobby project** focused on perfecting the user interface and frontend experience.

## 🚀 Current Status: Frontend Only
This project currently consists of the client-side interface. All data interactions are simulated or static, as backend logic is planned for a future phase of development.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **HTML5:** Semantic structure of the evaluation forms and dashboards.
* **CSS3:** Custom styling with a focus on responsiveness and user experience.
* **JavaScript (Vanilla):** Form handling, UI interactions, and basic front-end validation.

## ✨ Key Features (Current)
* **Evaluation Forms:** User-friendly inputs for rating instructors.
* **Responsive Design:** Works on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
* **Interactive UI:** Dynamic feedback and navigation elements.

## 📂 How to Run
Since this is a frontend-only project, you don't need to install any dependencies:
1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/f9ine99/instructor-evaluation-system.git
    ```
2.  Open `index.html` in any modern web browser.

## 🗺️ Roadmap
- [ ] Implement backend logic (Node.js/Express or Python/FastAPI).
- [ ] Connect to a database (PostgreSQL or MongoDB) to store evaluation results.
- [ ] Add User Authentication (Student/Admin login).
- [ ] Data visualization for evaluation statistics.
